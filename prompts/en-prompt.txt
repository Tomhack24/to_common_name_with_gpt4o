Convert the given scientific name into the most common, everyday English name that people would naturally think of when seeing the animal — not a formal taxonomic category.

【Rules】
1. If a familiar, everyday name exists for the specific species (e.g., Cat, Dog, Tiger), use it.  
2. If no such name exists, use the everyday word people would most likely think of upon seeing that animal, even if it represents a broader or informal group (e.g., Mouse, Monkey, Bat, Whale).  
3. Avoid obscure or technical names, and do not use phonetic spellings of the scientific name.  
4. If there is no suitable everyday name at any level, answer “None”.
